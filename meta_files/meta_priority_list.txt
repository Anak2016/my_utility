#--------long term priority
> watcha all MIT Deep Learning in 1 week (deadline 8/14/2019)
    :14 videos so 2 video a day.
> finish Sendex tutorial on self driving car (maximum 3 hours, sep 10 2019 )
    :Goal is to get a feel of what kinds of programming I need to build autonomous car.
    url: https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-self-driving-autonomous-cars-carla-python/

#--------todo 1 here>>
> check whether or not I can use Jetson from dr zhu to build self driving car
    :if the asnswer is yes, figure out what parts do I need to buy to fully build self seriving car.

> read syllbus and watch first lecture of foundation of ai and figure out what I need to do for project/papers review.
    :find out what the following is
        > Rejection sampling and approximate Bayesian computation
        > Markov chain Monte Carlo
        > Importance sampling
        > Canonical correlation analysis
        > Mutidimensional scaling
        > Gaussian processregression
        > Functional data analysis
        > Markov random fields vs hidden markov model
        > Particle filters
        > Self-organizing maps
        > Boltzmann machines
        > Applications of graphical models in artificial intelligence
        > Biclustering
        > Averaged one-dependence estimation

> read 1 papers on the far left about graph.
> work on writing report.

==> go to research_related
==> go to notes
==> go to side_project

> create a way to link evernote to my_utility project.
    : create another folder call "my_note" outside of my_utility but in one_drive awannaphasch2016@fau.edu
    : Should I collect all the note in my_utility project??

> write in README.txt how to use each command including
    :update papers
    :update meta file
    :update progress log to google calendar
    :update productivity log to sqlite

> download pdf files from trello
    :arranged downlowed file by topics and update arrange_papers.py accordingly

> export pycharmt setting to config

> use set up tools to setup environment when I move from computer to computer
    :currently i use config/__init__.py to manually install pip packages and conda packages
        => this can be done automatically using setuptools

> move code in example_code to cachers.
    :add comment and create hotkey to search them
> rewrite Rules section in readme.txt of research_related folder
> rearrange research paper in research-related.
> migrate example_code to cacher
> add html tags in md to add link to folders that contains research papers

> learn how to generate document in pycharm
    read: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/generating-reference-documentation.html
    :create documentation for my current code in the following
        =>my_utility, python_script

> test my_utility files and make a video/ blog about it
> find a way to document my project while I program it including the following formate
    :text doucment
    :flowchat
> exprot config for the follwoing
    : pycharm plugin
    :conda environment

> add arg_parse template in exmpale code (snippet)

> convert README.txt to README.md
    read: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
    : should i add "doctoc" to automate table fo contetn it required node.js


>figure out a way to finetune the following
    > read BINE paper and algorithm of BINE
    > algorihm of attentionwalk
    > algorithm of graph attention
> read my code and recall what I have done

> create utility function for karate club data preprocessing
    : check if similar things are availbel in torch?

> meet professor of Foundation of computational ai
    :ask him about gene and disease whether the problem is too simplified.
        => if it is, how can I fix it? add feature?
        => if not, what would he suggest me to focus on to improve the overall accuracy?

> code multi-label problem with deep learning
> read and recreate code from node2vec, attentionwalk, and bine.
    >read bine (focus on algorithm)
    >implement bine

> follow tutorial on pytorch
    : object detction finetuning
    url: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html

> add chatbot to the website
> self drivng car with pytorch
	:read https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-self-driving-cars-7f198ef4cfa2
	:use CARLA?
> read about lstm, and gan from deep leanring book
> learn fast.ai (by reading)
	:come up with a project
> recreate code from pytorch_geometric



>>>>update<<<<
-------utility_code
>find an app that can search and store snippet code
>merge the app to my_utility repo


-------side_project
> check AND fix why database does not update new data
> add auto_increment_id to model of productivity database
> add delete_by_id method to productivity class
> check why only the first detail is selected.
    :make sure that all of the detilas are selected.
> create keyword dir for survey papers.
    :create folder for papers/people/"name"/reserch topic
        eg
            papers/people/"name"/survey paper
            papers/people/"name"/GNN
            papers/people/"name"/CNN
            ...
    :write arrange_papers code to fit the new directory structure purposed above.

> create view for django
    > create option to plot productivity for a chosen period of time 5 days 10 days...
    > add delete by text/date option
