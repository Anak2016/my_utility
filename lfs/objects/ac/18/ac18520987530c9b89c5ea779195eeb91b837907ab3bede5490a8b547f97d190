## GNN Problem Set 
> GNN Problem set is defined as problems that can be used using **GNN Technique**
1. node classification
  1.single label
  2.multi labels
3. link prediction
4. heterogenous nodes classification
5. graph classification
6. point cloud classification
7. node imbalances problem
8. noises in graph
9. unlabel problems

### Unlabel Data [GNN problem set]
> this section focus on techniques that were used to solved unlabel data problem 
1. pseudo labels
2. graph embedding


## GNN technique
> GNN technique is defined as types of techniques are used to solved **any problem set** not restricted to **GNN problem set**
